- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the calculator.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds functionality to the calculator.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing scientific functions such as trigonometric operations, logarithms, etc.
- Adding keyboard support for input.
- Enhancing the user interface with animations and transitions.
- Including a history feature to display past calculations.
- Improving the overall design and user experience.
